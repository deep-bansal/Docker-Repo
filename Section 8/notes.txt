--- if we don't give any command in docker file then it used default command of base image (if any) like 
for php image

--- delegated in bind mount writes the changes in batches on host machine and not for very change (optimisation)

--- depends_on helps in running other containers with main container

--build option builds custom images always

--- copy and run commands not avail in docker-compose

--- difference in bind mounts and image?
    bind mounts helpful in dev phase only after that image helps
