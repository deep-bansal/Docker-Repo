--------
Volumes
--------
They persist only container shut down and removal
They are of different types
1. emptyDir - no specific settings using it as it is with default settings 
              always creates a new empty directory
              downside - * if we have different replicas then it sends req to other pod
                         our data is not found as volume is bound to pod
                         * it creates an emptyDir per pod instead of sharing single one 
                         across multiple pods
2. hostPath - multiple pods can share same volume on host machine
              like a bind mount
              path needs to be specified which will be bound to folder inside pod
              type specifies to create dir if not exist
              downside - * worker node specific what if we have multiple worker nodes?
3. csi -      container storage interface
              flexible type
              instead of writing provider specific code we can write csi format and use with 
              cloud provider
