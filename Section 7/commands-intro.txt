With docker we know we can create project and wrap in containers but what if we want to create the app
inside the container like npm init command to start inside the container only. That is what utility 
containers help us to achieve. 

---------------------------------------------------------
if we run 
---------------------------------------------------------

docker run node

the container starts but stops immediately because it needs to be run in interactive mode

---------------------------------------------------------
so we use
---------------------------------------------------------

docker run -it -d node

it keeps container up and running but in detach mode 
we can use docker attach node to bring in attach mode

(base) deepbansal@Deeps-MacBook-Air Docker % docker run -it node
Welcome to Node.js v21.6.2.
Type ".help" for more information.
> npm init (entered by me)
npm should be run outside of the Node.js REPL, in your normal shell.
(Press Ctrl+D to exit.)
> 

---------------------------------------------------------
now if we want to enter command in this detach container
---------------------------------------------------------

docker exec 

allows you to run commands inside of running container beside the default commands,this container executes
besides the command specified in dockerFile that continue to execute we run additional commands from outside

docker exec -it elegant_gauss npm init

using this command we have created a project inside of container without installing npm in local machine

other syntax 
by default docker run node executes default command when node starts by we can overwrite that command

docker run -it node npm init

basically for different projects we need to install different tools like
for node npm 
for python python
like these so to avoid these we use utility containers
