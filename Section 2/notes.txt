docker image - it creates an image of docker file and gives image ID
docker run image id - it runs image and create container for it
docker start container_name - runs already create container
docker attach container_name - it attaches the running detache container

-t flag-> if we ru container originally with -t flag then not required in start command as it remembers

docker image inspect image_id -> gives all the information of image like port, ip everything

To copy to and extract from running container

docker cp folder_name:/
